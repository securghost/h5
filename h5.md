# [h5 Spring2024](https://terokarvinen.com/2024/information-security-2024-spring/#h5-spring2024)

**This report follows the rule - latest first. Meaning first task is the last in the report, and last is the first.** 

## [c) Choose a password manager. First, create a short list of some password managers; then pick one. Explain:](https://terokarvinen.com/2024/information-security-2024-spring/#h5-spring2024)

    What threats does it protect against?
    What information is encrypted, what's not?
    What's the license? How would you describe license's effects or categorize it?
    Where is the data stored? If in "the cloud", which country / juristiction / which companies? If on local disk, where?
    How is the data protected?

## [b) Crack this hash: 8eb8e307a6d649bc7fb51443a06a216f](https://terokarvinen.com/2022/cracking-passwords-with-hashcat/)

## [a) Install Hashcat. Test it with a sample hash. See Karvinen 2022: Cracking Passwords with Hashcat](https://terokarvinen.com/2022/cracking-passwords-with-hashcat/)

Installing the Hashcat:

Created a new directory for our work:

    $ mkdir hashed
    $ cd hashed

Got a big dictionary (Rockyou)

    $ wget https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/raw/master/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt.tar.gz
    $ tar xf rockyou.txt.tar.gz
    $ rm rockyou.txt.tar.gz

I was not able to crack the example hash from the example as it kept saying to me that he file does not exist. However, I was able to crack the b) task hash.

## [x) Read and summarize € Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: 2.3 One-Way Functions and 2.4 One-Way Hash Functions.](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/applied-cryptography-protocols/9781119096726/10_chap02.html#chap02-sec003)

### 2.3 ONE-WAY FUNCTIONS

One-way functions are like puzzles: easy to solve in one direction but hard to reverse. They're not directly useful for encryption, but trapdoor functions have a secret "shortcut" for reversing them.
An analogy is like breaking a watch: easy to dismantle, hard to reassemble, but with the instructions, it's easier. 
In summary, one-way functions are like one-way streets, and trapdoor functions are like having a hidden shortcut back.

### 2.4 ONE-WAY HASH FUNCTIONS

A one-way hash function is like a digital fingerprint for data. It takes any input and turns it into a unique fixed-length code, making it easy to check if two pieces of data are the same without revealing the original data itself. 
It's like comparing fingerprints to identify people without needing to see their faces. This is handy for things like verifying files or ensuring the integrity of transactions. 
For example, if someone claims to have a specific file, you can ask for its hash code. If it matches the one you have, it's likely the same file. This helps prevent tampering, like ensuring a $100 transaction stays $100 and doesn't magically turn into $1000.
Adding a secret key to the mix creates a message authentication code (MAC), which adds an extra layer of security. Only those with the key can verify the hash value, making it even more secure for sensitive information. 
It's like having a secret stamp that only certain people can use to confirm the authenticity of a document.
