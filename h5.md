# [h5 Spring2024](https://terokarvinen.com/2024/information-security-2024-spring/#h5-spring2024)

**This report follows the rule - from latest to first. Meaning first task is the last in the report, and last is the first.** 

## [c) Choose a password manager. First, create a short list of some password managers; then pick one. Explain:](https://terokarvinen.com/2024/information-security-2024-spring/#h5-spring2024)

**[The Best Password Managers of 2024 according to Forbes:](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/software/best-password-managers/)**

    Norton Password Manager: Best overall
    NordPass: Best for businesses
    Dashlane: Best for reliability
    Bitwarden: Best open-source manager
    1Password: Best for securing company secrets
    KeePass: Best for programmers
    Keeper: Best for scalability
    LastPass: Best for a single-user account

**My thoughts:** Even though, it is said under the headline, that they earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor AND Commissions do not affect their editors' opinions or evaluations, it does not quite seems to be that, as we're still finding LastPass in the list. 

Under the LastPass information link "Why We Picked It" there's an 

    Editor’s note:  Since this article was published, Last Pass has confirmed that it had been breached and users’ password vaults 
    were compromised in August 2022. A class action lawsuit was filed in January 2023 for “failure to exercise reasonable care in
    securing and safeguarding highly sensitive consumer data.” This is a red flag worth investigating and possibly taking action on.
    LastPass recommends changing passwords and remaining alert for phishing scams. For more details visit the LastPass blog.

So I'd rather not put it into the list at all, as they seem to have already 2 breaches. So, not sure, how much I'd actually trust that list. 

**[Best password manager of 2024 according to TechRadar:](https://www.techradar.com/best/password-manager#section-how-we-tested-the-best-password-managers)**

1. NordPass - Best password manager overall
2. Dashlane - Best password manager for security
3. Bitwarden - Best free password manager
4. Keeper - Best password manager for mid-sized business
5. LogMeOnce - Best passwordless password manager
6. N-Able Passportal - Best password manager for enterprise

**My thoughts:** There are few who's presence seems to be present in both lists - NordPass, Dashline, Bitwarden and Keeper. 

List of some password managers:
- Google Password Manager
- Firefox Password Manager
- pass

My choice will probably mostlikely be NordPass for now:

    What threats does it protect against?
    What information is encrypted, what's not?
    What's the license? How would you describe license's effects or categorize it?
    Where is the data stored? If in "the cloud", which country / juristiction / which companies? If on local disk, where?
    How is the data protected?

## [b) Crack this hash: 8eb8e307a6d649bc7fb51443a06a216f](https://terokarvinen.com/2022/cracking-passwords-with-hashcat/)

## [a) Install Hashcat. Test it with a sample hash. See Karvinen 2022: Cracking Passwords with Hashcat](https://terokarvinen.com/2022/cracking-passwords-with-hashcat/)

Installing the Hashcat:

Created a new directory for our work:

    $ mkdir hashed
    $ cd hashed

Got a big dictionary (Rockyou)

    $ wget https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/raw/master/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt.tar.gz
    $ tar xf rockyou.txt.tar.gz
    $ rm rockyou.txt.tar.gz

I was not able to crack the example hash from the example as it kept saying to me that he file does not exist. However, I was able to crack the b) task hash.

## [x) Read and summarize € Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: 2.3 One-Way Functions and 2.4 One-Way Hash Functions.](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/applied-cryptography-protocols/9781119096726/10_chap02.html#chap02-sec003)

### 2.3 ONE-WAY FUNCTIONS

One-way functions are like puzzles: easy to solve in one direction but hard to reverse. They're not directly useful for encryption, but trapdoor functions have a secret "shortcut" for reversing them.
An analogy is like breaking a watch: easy to dismantle, hard to reassemble, but with the instructions, it's easier. 
In summary, one-way functions are like one-way streets, and trapdoor functions are like having a hidden shortcut back.

### 2.4 ONE-WAY HASH FUNCTIONS

A one-way hash function is like a digital fingerprint for data. It takes any input and turns it into a unique fixed-length code, making it easy to check if two pieces of data are the same without revealing the original data itself. 
It's like comparing fingerprints to identify people without needing to see their faces. This is handy for things like verifying files or ensuring the integrity of transactions. 
For example, if someone claims to have a specific file, you can ask for its hash code. If it matches the one you have, it's likely the same file. This helps prevent tampering, like ensuring a $100 transaction stays $100 and doesn't magically turn into $1000.
Adding a secret key to the mix creates a message authentication code (MAC), which adds an extra layer of security. Only those with the key can verify the hash value, making it even more secure for sensitive information. 
It's like having a secret stamp that only certain people can use to confirm the authenticity of a document.
